# Bacchus Marsh Grammar Discord Server Bot
This is a Discord Bot created by Tristen L. and Darrel M.

### About
This is a Discord Bot created for the student-led 'BMG Subjects' Discord Server. The server is accessible through the BMG Discord Hub, and would host a range of channels for categories of school subjects, and their respective sub-subjects (The Science category would host Biology, Physics and more).

The bot is designed to automate several facets of the server, like:
* Setting Reminders for upcoming SAC's and Events
* Bulletin updates from Schoolbox
* Self-role functionality through reactions
